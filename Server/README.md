### Project Overview

This project appears to manage multimedia content (audio, video) with functionality for user authentication, room management, and media streaming. It also uses WebSockets for real-time interactions and provides upload capabilities for audio/video files.

### 1. **Entry Point**

* **`index.js`** : The main entry point of the application. It sets up the server, loads middleware, routes, and establishes connections (like databases or WebSocket servers).

### 2. **Middleware**

Middleware is used for request processing, often before it reaches the route handler.

* **`check-auth.js`** : This middleware likely verifies user authentication, checking for tokens (e.g., JWT) and validating them before allowing access to certain routes.

### 3. **Models**

Models represent your database schema and data structures, likely using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) such as Mongoose for MongoDB or Sequelize for SQL databases.

* **`Audio.model.js`** : Manages the schema for audio files (e.g., metadata like title, duration, user ID).
* **`relation.model.js`** : Could define relationships between users, rooms, or other entities (like follows or friendships).
* **`Room.model.js`** : Defines rooms for live streaming or chat, with details like room name, members, and creation time.
* **`SuspendedUser.model.js`** : Tracks users who are suspended from accessing certain functionalities.
* **`User.model.js`** : Represents user information (e.g., username, email, hashed password, roles).
* **`Video.model.js`** : Manages video files, their metadata, and associations (e.g., user ID, duration, resolution).

### 4. **Routes**

Routes map HTTP endpoints to controller functions, handling all HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.).

* **Admin Routes** :
* **`Admin.route.js`** : Likely manages admin functionalities like user suspension or content moderation.
* **Audio Routes** :
* **`AudioList.route.js`** : Fetches a list of available audios.
* **`Audio.route.js`** : Manages audio file operations like upload, delete, or edit.
* **`GetAudios.route.js`** : Fetches audio files for users, possibly filtering based on user or preferences.
* **`GetUserAudios.route.js`** : Retrieves audios uploaded by a specific user.
* **`UploadAudio.route.js`** : Handles audio file uploads from users.
* **User Routes** :
* **`Login.route.js`** : Manages user login and authentication.
* **`SignUp.route.js`** : Handles user registration.
* **`GetUserData.route.js`** : Retrieves user data such as profile information.
* **`UpdateUser.route.js`** : Updates user information like name, email, password.
* **Video Routes** :
* **`UploadVideo.route.js`** : Handles video file uploads.
* **`VideoList.route.js`** : Fetches a list of available videos.
* **`GetVideos.route.js`** : Retrieves videos, possibly sorted or filtered.
* **`GetUserVideos.route.js`** : Fetches videos uploaded by a particular user.
* **`TrendingVideos.route.js`** : Displays videos that are trending based on metrics like views or likes.
* **`LikedVideos.route.js`** : Retrieves videos liked by a specific user.
* **`Video.route.js`** : Manages individual video file operations.
* **Other Routes** :
* **`Playlists.route.js`** : Manages playlist creation, update, and deletion.
* **`File.route.js`** : Likely manages file uploads/downloads not related to audio or video.
* **`Recommendations.route.js`** : Provides personalized recommendations for users.
* **`UpdateRoom.route.js`** : Updates room details, like name or member count.

### 5. **SocketEvents**

Socket events handle real-time functionality, likely for messaging, streaming, and user actions in rooms.

* **Room Management** :
* **`CreateRoom.js`** : Handles room creation for audio/video streaming or chats.
* **`JoinRoom.js`** : Manages users joining existing rooms.
* **`JoinSelfRoom.js`** : May let users rejoin rooms they created or were recently active in.
* **`LeaveRoom.js`** : Handles users leaving rooms.
* **`RoleModeration.js`** : Handles role-based actions like muting or banning users.
* **Messaging** :
* **`SendMessage.js`** : Manages sending messages in a room (e.g., chat).
* **Stream Control** :
* **`StreamSocketEvents/ChangeTimeStamp.js`** : Allows changing the video’s timestamp during playback.
* **`StreamSocketEvents/FetchVideo.js`** : Fetches a video stream for playback.
* **`StreamSocketEvents/PauseVideo.js`** : Pauses a video stream in real-time.
* **`StreamSocketEvents/PlaybackSpeed.js`** : Adjusts the video’s playback speed.
* **`StreamSocketEvents/PlayVideo.js`** : Starts video playback.
* **User Moderation** :
* **`SuspendUser/SuspendUser.js`** : Handles suspending users from rooms or site-wide based on violations.

### 6. **Uploads**

This folder contains files uploaded by users.

* **`icon.png`** : Could be a placeholder image or icon used in the UI.
* **`SoundHelix-Song-1.mp3`** : A sample audio file.
* **`temp.mp4`** : A sample or temporarily uploaded video file.

---

### 7. **Utils**

Utility files provide helper functions used across the application for tasks like uploading files or interacting with cloud storage.

* **`cloudinary.js`** : Likely handles integration with Cloudinary for media file uploads and transformations.
* **`multer.js`** : Configures the `multer` library for handling file uploads, possibly setting file size limits, destination, and file validation.

---

### 8. **Package Files**

* **`package.json`** &  **`package-lock.json`** : Define the project dependencies, scripts, and configurations. The lock file ensures consistent dependency versions across environments.
